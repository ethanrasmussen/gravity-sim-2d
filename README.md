# Usage:

This program opens up a window which begins the simulation with 2 celestial objects: a sun & an orbiting planet. The user can then click & drag to spawn in new celestial objects, with their initial velocity & direction being impacted by the direction & intensity of the mouse-drag.

To run this program, you'll need to have .NET installed for C#. Then, clone the repo & run: 

`dotnet build && dotnet run`
